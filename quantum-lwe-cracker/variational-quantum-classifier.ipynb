    "**Interpretation of the results** The model generalizes differently.\n",
    " - Same dataset: Generalizes as expected.\n",
    " - Increased iterations: A increased number of random data selections, even if selection earlier with lower iteration count was random, still results in decreased generalizability.\n",
    " - Key shift: Model generalizability is gone when the key is changed; it can be inferred that the key forms an integral algebraic and algorithmic component of LWE.\n",
    " - RNG and Key shift: Model generalizability retains key aspects as the previously bi-directional model is now gravitating towards one axis of positive accuracy.\n",
    "   - This suggests that our model is able to capture the complexity of both the same and RNG/key dataset, but missing perhaps an additional layer that could increase generalizability for key shift. However, the implementation of such a layer ~~could screw up the model~~ could threaten both model performance and adaptiveness.\n",
    " - RNG Shift: Again, while not as bad as the key shift, some structure is preserved as seen in the worst weights' flipping."

    " - Implemented cloudpickle weight-logging; the normal weight-logging system logged the last weights because of auto-updates (which in our case isn‚Äôt a feature because we want to freeze the weights in time)\n",
    " - Added CPU optimization\n",
    " - **Criticism of paper** Implemented RNG seeds for reproducibility, though the RNG seed variation in real world encryption schemes makes realist implementation difficult, which is why the accuracy is worsened (closer to 50%) when testing on re-generated datasets.\n",
    "   - There is an argument that an message'll be encrypted using the same dataset and so this may give us an advantage depending on implementation. Real architectures are more likely to use true cryptographic randomness, however.\n",
    "   - The model should be tested with consistent RNG seeds accross `pqc-math-sim.cpp` and `experiments-2.ipynb` to test whether the model is learning past  quirks of mathematical interactions with the key.\n",
    "     - However, the model, in real world scenarios, could be used to memorize quirks of 1 key if trained as such.\n",
    " - TODO: calcultae bayesian limit, digitize BCE notes and other notes, overnight run again\n",
    "   - Add a section like \"This model is most generealizable when {Implementation of LWE like this}\"\n",
    " - TO include in paper:\n",
    "   - Our VQC consistently outperforms classical models such as XGBoost\n",
    "   - 70% (regular and inverted) = Eval on same dataset with same key\n",
    "   - 54-inverted% and 60% = Eval with different RNG (partial generalization)\n",
    "   - 64-inverted% and 62% = Different RNG, Different Key\n",
    "   - **Also include old sep evaluations that lead to conclusion 2-layered MSE as best**\n",

    "6/20/25\n",
    " - TO Include in paper: \n",
    "   - Got 24%(76-inverted) to 74%. QML, especially VQC, is more fragile than classical ML, but outperforms it.\n",
    "   - The accuracy decrease on increased iterations (past evaluations) isn't because of luck being eliminated. The circuit gets tired or something. Because 50 iters and consistently getting same accuracy on data generated under same conditions still has a point.\n",
    "   - Preventing circuit getting tired is like future thing. Not my research's focus for now. Maybe one line suggesting `time.sleep()` that sounds fancy (or hardware fatigue?)\n",
    " - Know what I need to do to make this a fire paper, don't wanna do it\n",
    "\n",
    "6/21/25\n",
    "  - Included ROC/AUC, testing over iterations reveal 80% peak accuracy on 20 samples, with accuracy reducing to 50% on increased samples\n",
    "  - TODO: Attempt to hack the iteration sample thing to attempt to show 80% accuracy accross entire dataset by splitting it (the circuit gets tired)\n",
    "  - TODO: Reccomended t-SNE, weight loading, hybrid BCE/MSE based on how strong confidence is to build model confidence\n",
    "  - Include in paper: 70% accuracy, but ROC/AUC reflect 50% accuracy seen in later iters. Could temporary shoots of accuracy be due to lucky batches?\n",
    "    - No. We continously test randomly, pulling 50 samples out of 2000 samples.\n",
    "  - *TL;DR* There is something weird going on"
